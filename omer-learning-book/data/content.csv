Do thus with your vineyard, with your olive grove.""""

""There is some evidence that shmita was practiced in biblical times. In
his commentary on Behar, for instance, Rabbi Joseph Hertz noted that
the Roman historian Tacitus said shmita observance was proof of Jewish
laziness, and that, as documented by Jewish–Roman historian Josephus,
both Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar canceled taxes that
otherwise would have been levied on Jews in the shmita year because
they were not working their fields [19]. There is even Talmudic
evidence that fences were removed during the shmita year, so as to not
only allow easier field access to all but to remove symbols of private
ownership [20]. Still, it is unclear to what extent shmita was
practiced in biblical times, or if it, or yovel for that matter, was
even ever once practiced fully. The presence of the laws within the
Torah provides proof that shmita as codified was not naturally
practiced, and biblical prophets chastised the people specifically for
not observing shmita.""",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/7/8/100/htm,OmerBot,About Shemitah,yes

“A loan is kind of a mechanism for the rich people to become richer at the expense of the poor people,” Porat said. 

Shmita was one of a few ways the Bible tries to correct for this imbalance, Porat said. For example, the Torah prohibits lenders from charging interest. 

“Shmita is part of a complex of ideas in the Bible that essentially promote a socioeconomic vision in which people are given second chances to start over again in which they might change their economic and social position,” said Suzanne Last Stone, a professor of Jewish law at Cardozo Law School, Yeshiva University. “It kind of is like a reboot economically.” """"",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-yom-kippur-reminder-the-idea-of-debt-forgiveness-dates-at-least-as-far-back-as-the-bible-11631729059,,About Shemitah,yes

During Easter, it's common for families to give baby rabbits as presents, not realizing that rabbits are not a starter pet.

While rabbits are litter trainable, and indeed, essentially litter train themselves, they need a decent area to roam and cannot be constantly caged. This area needs to be rabbit-proofed, e.g., free of wood and cables, both of which they will happily chew on. They require a LOT of hay, all day long, their litters will need to be cleaned regularly, and some will need vet visits for things such as molar trims on a semi-regular basis. They also require regular nail trims, which take practice, and grooming such as brushing, so that they do not go into stasis from ingesting too much fur. They like being petted, but they do not enjoy being picked up, and so kids often do not find them to be ""fun"" pets. Finally, their lifespans are commonly 10 - 12 years, and can be as long as 15 - 16 years.

For all these reasons, shortly after Easter, rabbits commonly get dumped at shelters or with the Friends of Rabbits that is the premier rabbit adopted network in this area, or worse, turned out into the wild, where domesticated rabbits will quickly die, either of fright or by becoming prey to a local predator.

""""On first blush, the Jewish environmental movement’s embrace of shmita
echoes the reinvention of Tu B’Shvat, the modern-day equivalent of a
Jewish Earth Day. A non-biblical holiday, Tu B’Shvat became the New
Year for Trees (one of five New Year days described in the Talmud
(Rosh Hashanah 1:1)) during Judaism’s Second Temple era, roughly the
500-year period before Christian tradition dates the birth of
Jesus. While Tu B’Shvat always was connected to both trees and the
land, it originally was a tax holiday—the day that determined in which
year a tree’s fruit would be tithed.  After Jewish sovereignty was
lost over the Jewish homeland (what largely constitutes modern-day
Israel) in the year 70, Tu B’Shvat fell into disuse. In the mid-1500s,
kabbalists in the Galilean city of Tsfat revived Tu B’Shvat observance
and, inspired by Tu B’Shvat’s earthy roots, reinvented the holiday as
one celebrating trees and nature as manifestations of God’s wonders
and the abundance that God

As the kabbalists reclaimed Tu B’Shvat, most of the change in Tu
B’Shvat observance from about 500 years ago to today was a reinvention
of the holiday—inspired by history but newly invented. It was as if
the kabbalists reclaimed Tu B’Shvat at its roots and reinvented it by
growing a new and different tree than those roots had grown
previously. Shmita has been a different story. Shmita’s resurgence has
been one of rediscovery. It is as if the modern Jewish environmental
movement reclaimed shmita as a fully-grown but long-neglected tree and
reinvented new ways of using its fruit.""""

Shemitah, with its 7 year cycle, attempts to address both social and environmental inbalances  The counting of the omer, with it's 7 weeks of 7 day cycles, is often used as an opportunity for spirtual growth.   

Here's unique and especially accessible project for connecting with the counting of the Omer: The Omer Mixtape:

""""Counting the Omer began as a count toward the Spring harvest, and it has evolved into a spiritual accounting. Kabbalism, Jewish mysticism, provides a framework for counting the Omer as a period for introspection and personal growth, in preparation for receiving the Torah on Shavuot (which falls at the end of the Omer).

Each week of the Omer focuses on a different one of the sephirot, elements of the Divine, as well as how the aspects of those elements are at play with each other. Many people will learn a piece of Torah (often Pirkei Avot), to aid with their introspection and forge personal connections to the spiritual content.

When thinking about what Torah I wanted to study, I wanted it to be deeply personal as well as universal, because inner spiritual growth must be connected to those around us and tethered to the world we live in.

For me, pop culture, and especially music, is a place where I find my Torah in the world.

We are always consuming that content, and I believe there is Torah (Jewish learning and values) all around us. This is an opportunity for me to make explicit connections between the Torah of the world, the music that I love, and the Torah of the Omer and Kabbalah. I can better understand the Divine elements and explore my inner self by connecting the elements to songs that already hold meaning for me.""""

What is a Buy Nothing group?  Simply, it’s a hyperlocal group of people living in the same area who use Facebook to give away “gifts” of items they no longer want to others who’d like to have them.  It’s also a place where people can “wish” for something they’d like that may be taking up space in a neighbor’s home.  I’m an admin of a Buy Nothing group that covers the northwest corner of Arlington and part of Falls Church.  There are similar groups throughout the DMV area so there’s probably one in your neighborhood too.

Sometimes “gifted” items are small, like moving boxes or padded envelopes.  Last week, a parent asked whether anyone had a tri-fold presentation board used at science fairs because her daughter needed one for school.  I happened to have one of those boards in my dining room serving no useful purpose for the past several years.  Within an hour the item was out of my house and being put to good use by someone else.  Not only is this environmentally friendly, but it is helpful to both parties.

You can find just about anything on a Buy Nothing group.  There are always toys, baby items, clothes, jewelry, dishes, furniture, puzzles, books, groceries, plants, even some Jewish items.  I got a box of Passover breakfast cereal during the holiday and while I can’t say it was especially tasty I can say that it was appreciated.  Some people were getting rid of frog items and those were great at my seder table.  And I've passed along many items I no longer need to others.

Sometimes I’m amazed that people ask for and find the craziest things.   This week someone asked to borrow an adult-sized giraffe costume and received one!!  Rebbi would have loved that!

There’s a guy in our group who enjoys tinkering with electronics.  When people offer to give away partially functioning small appliances and no one else wants them, he repairs them, and then gives the items or the proceeds to charity,

I especially love what I call “mother-in-law” gifts.  A well-meaning mom purchases something for her daughter-in-law or grandkids with the best of intentions but it just isn’t their taste.  Sometimes it is MY taste!  Then there are the wedding gifts – beautiful items used infrequently and stashed away in a closet for years until it is time to declutter.  As a result, I have a lovely vase on my dining room table.  I also have some art for my home library.

If you need help finding your local Buy Nothing group, I’m happy to help.  I also think it would be great to start a CEH Judaica swap if others are interested. 

Here’s a New York Times article about Buy Nothing.  Can you believe that people in New York were offering and claiming items like dryer lint and pickle juice?  Turns out that dryer lint is great in the fireplace and pickle juice kills weeds in the garden.  Who knew?

Every plastic bag or bit of plastic wrap can be recycled at a grocery store plastic bag recycling bin.

Glass can be recycled by dropping it off at special glass recycle bins located throughout the county.

Electronics and household hazardous materials can be recycled by stopping by the Arlington Water Pollution Control Plant located near Four Mile Run.

That reminded me about the power of eating less meat! This article in Greenpeace explains how eating less meat can directly impact our environment.

""""Meat is an important part of heritage and identity. It’s a cultural staple in many communities across the globe. But with a rising global middle class, societies are becoming meat obsessed. Nowhere else is this more prevalent than rich nations whose appetite for beef, pork and processed chicken have reached a tipping point. The research is clear — a diet heavy in meat increases the risk of obesity, cancer and heart disease.

But it also makes the planet sick. The livestock sector — raising cows, pigs and chickens — generates as much greenhouse gas emissions as all cars, trucks and automobiles combined. Cattle ranchers have clear cut millions of square kilometers of forests for grazing pastures, decimating natural “carbon sinks.”""""",https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/sustainable-agriculture/eco-farming/eat-more-plants/,Sylvia,Improving our Environment,yes

This requirement, like that of keeping Kosher, can inspire us to  pay more attention to the source of our food.

""""Another example of what Shmita can teach us stems from the way that Shmita demands that we consider the story behind the food staring back at us from the shelves of our supermarkets.  Knowing the answers to questions such as where the food was grown and how the food was grown and by whom the food was grown is essential to doing Shmita “right”.  This information helps concerned consumers to know how to relate with the food (specifically regarding kedushat shvi’it) and decide if they want to buy the food at all.

Imagine Jews asking these same kinds of questions during non-Shmita years to make sure they’re doing other things “right” according to the laws and values of our Jewish tradition.

While there are Jews already doing so, the Shmita year should encourage and train more and more of us to inquire about our food all the time.  The questions we ask during Shmita should continue to be asked even when the Shmita year is done:  Where was this food grown that I am considering buying and eating, meaning how far away was the farm it was picked from and how much fuel was needed to transport it to where I live?  How was this food grown, meaning was it grown using a system that cares for and is sensitive to the needs of the Earth or was only short-term human profit the guiding value?  Who grew the food, meaning how were the workers in the field treated and under what conditions did they labor?""""

I'm a big fan of my local Buy Nothing Facebook group, where members offer items they no longer need to their neighbors, for free.  I've gotten quite a few baby items from the group, which both reduces the need for new items to be produced and saves money. Consider going through items you no longer need and offering them up as well.
