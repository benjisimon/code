When you feel how depressingly 
slowly you climb, 
it's well to remember that 
      Things Take Time.

The road to wisdom? - Well, it's plain 
and simple to express: 
   Err 
   and err 
   and err again 
   but less 
   and less 
   and less.

The way to grow grand

There is

to do  
all things  
with art- 
lessness.

THE MIRACLE OF SPRING

We glibly talk
of nature's laws
but do things have
a natural cause?
Black earth turned into
yellow crocus
in undiluted
hocus-pocus.

TWO WORDS

Two words express
My love galore:
Nevertheless,

A PSYCHOLOGICAL TIP

Whenever you're called on to make up your mind,
and you're hampered by not having any,
the best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find,
is simply by spinning a penny.
No - not so that chance shall decide the affair
while you're passively standing there moping;
but the moment the penny is up in the air,
you suddenly know what you're hoping

A WORD TO THE WISE

Let the world pass in its time-ridden race; 
   never get caught in its snare.

Remember, the only acceptable case

THE ETERNAL TWINS

Taking fun

CONSOLATION GROOK

Losing one glove
is certainly painful,
but nothing
   compared to the pain,
of losing one,
throwing away the other,
and finding
   the first one again.

OMNISCIENCE

Knowing what
thou knowest not
is in a sense
omniscience.

--

SIMPLY ASSISTING GOD

I am a humble artist
moulding my earthly clod,
adding my labour to nature's,
simply assisting God.

Not that my effort is needed;
yet somehow, I understand,
my maker has willed it that I too should have
unmoulded clay in my hand.

--

HINT AND SUGGESTION
Admonitory grook addressed to youth.

The human spirit sublimates
the impulses it thwarts;
a healthy sex life mitigates
the lust for other sports.

MANKIND

Men, said the Devil,
are good to their brothers:
they donâ€™t want to mend
their own ways, but each other's.

NAIVE

Naive you are

THE MIRACLE OF SPRING

DREAM INTERPRETATION

Everything's either

PRAYER
to the sun above the clouds.

Sun that givest all things birth,
shine on everything on earth!

If that's too much to demand,
shine at least on this our land.

If even that's too much for thee,
shine at any rate on me.

CIRCUMSCRIPTURE

As Pastor X steps out of bed
    he slips a neat disguise on:
that halo round his priestly head

SOCIAL MECHANISM

When people always
try to take
the very smallest
piece of cake
how can it also

that that's the one

A TOAST

The soul may be a mere pretence,
the mind makes very little sense.
So let us value the appeal
of that which we can taste and feel.

ON PROBLEMS

Our choicest plans
     have fallen through,
our airiest castles
     tumbled over,
because of lines
     we neatly drew
and later neatly
     stumbled over.

AN ETHICAL GROOK

I see
   and I hear
      and I speak no evil;
I carry
   no malice
      within my breast;
yet quite without
   wishing
      a man to the Devil
one may be
   permitted
      to hope for the best.

LILAC TIME

The lilacs are flowering, sweet and sublime,
     with a perfume that goes to the head;
and lovers meander in prose and rhyme,
trying to say -
          for the thousandth time -
     wha's easier done than said.

THE DOUBLE-DOOR EFFECT

Double doors are justified
because they're comfortably wide.
Therefore you only half undo'em;

MAJORITY RULE

His party was the Brotherhood of Brothers,
and there were more of them than of the others.
That is, they constituted that minority
which formed the greater part of the majority.
Within the party, he was of the faction
that was supported by the greater fraction.
And in each group, within each group, he sought
the group that could command the most support.
The final group had finally elected
a triumvirate whom they all respected.
Now, of these three, two had final word,
because the two could overrule the third.
One of these two was relatively weak,
so one alone stood at the final peak.
He was: THE GREATER NUMBER of the pair
which formed the most part of the three that were
elected by the most of those whose boast
it was to represent the most of the most
of most of most of the entire state -
or of the most of it at any rate.
He never gave himself a moment's slumber
but sought the welfare of the greater number.
And all people, everywhere they went,
knew to their cost exactly what it meant
to be dictated to by the majority.
But that meant nothing, - they were the minority.

ATOMYRIADES

Nature, it seems, is the popular name
for milliards and milliards and milliards

ROAD SENSE

God save us, now they're murdering
     another winding road,
and another lovely countryside
     will take another load
of pantechnicon and car and motorbike.
     They're busy making biger roads,
     and better roads and more,
so that people can discover
     even faster than before
     that everything is everywhere alike.

OUR GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT

We must expect posterity
to view with some asperity
  the marvels and the wonders
    we're passing on to it;
but it should change its attitude
to one of heartfelt gratitude
  when thinking of the blunders
    we didn't quite commit.

--

THE TRUE DEFENCE

The only defence
that is more than pretence
   is to act on the fact
that there is no defence.

PAST PLUPERFECT

The past, - well, it's just like
              our Great-Aunt Laura,
who cannot or will not perceive
that though she is welcome,
              and though we adore her,
yet now it is time to leave.

MY FAITH IN DOCTORS

My faith in doctors

Just one thing spoils it;
     their pretence

DEFENCE WANTED

In International
      Consequences
the players must reckon

We have a defence

      against our own?

GETTING DOWN TO FUNDAMENTALS

It will steadily shrink,

GROOK TO STIMULATE GRATITUDE

BRIDGE OR TUNNEL?
Channel project.

A tunnel would be possible,
   a bridge would also do,
but wouldn't it be better to

Let bridge and tunnel undulate

keeping green the memories
   of those who went before.

LOSING FACE

The noble art of losing face

MEETING THE EYE

You'll probably find
      that it suits your book
to be a bit cleverer
      than you look.
Observe that the easiest
      method by far

IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

A poet should be of the
                  old-fahioned meaningless brand:
obscure, esoteric, symbolic, -
              the critics demand it;
so if there's a poem of mine
              that you do understand
I'll gladly explain what it means
              till you don't understand it.

GROOK ON LONG-WINDED AUTHORS

Long-winded writers I abhor,
    and glib, prolific chatters;
give me the ones who tear and gaw

    they only write what matters.

OUT OF TIME

My old clock used to tell the time

TAUGHT

      We are taught to live,
      we are
          taught to feel.
We are taught to conform and conceal.      

      We are taught so well

THE LITTLE MERMAID'S LITTLE SISTER 

The Little Mermaid's Little Sister
was also partly girl and cod

I, with my fond intention,

THE TYRANNY OF THINGS

I am trying to rule

which I thought

All of a sudden
        a doubt take wings:
Do they...
        or could it be..? 

A hardhanded hunch
        in my mind's ear rings

MOTIVATION OF TOASTS FOR A STEADFAST CHARACTER

CAPACITY 
A contribution to the psychology of disappointment 

Some people live
 in a dream of what'll
allow them to
 live their dream:
they solemnly hold out
 a half-pint bottle

 a pint of cream.

--

THAT WEARY FEELING 

Do you know that weary feeling
 when your mind is strangely strangled
and your head is like a ball of wool
 that's very, very tangled;
and the tempo of your thinking
 must be lenient and mild,
as though you were explaining
 to a very little child.

--

ONE'S OWN WEATHER 

You're squandering
 spleen on your brothers,

 good self-pity too,
if you think
 that there's sun on the others

TWO PASSIVISTS
Eradicate the optimist

MOUSE AND MAN
A relativistic grook on co-existence 

A human being sharing with a mouse.
Each thinks himself the master of the house.
In fact, of course, each occupier's place is
the other's insulating interspaces.

THREE FACTS ABOUT TRAFFIC 

Three facts, quite easy,

that roads are greasy,

VITA BREVIS 

A lifetime

ETERNITY AND THE CLOCK
A homage to finity 

Eternity's one of those mental blocks-
 the concept is inconceivable.
The clock concedes it in ticks and tocks,
 belittled, belaboured, believable. 

Each passing moment is seized and chewed
 with argument incontestable.
Premasticated, like baby food,
 eternity is digestible.

ASTRO-GYMNASTICS
Do-it-yourself grook 

Go on a starlit night,
 stand on your head,
leave your feet dangling
 outwards into space,
and let the starry
 firmament you tread
be, for the moment,
 your elected base. 

Feel Earth's colossal weight
 of ice and granite,
of molten magma,
 water, iron, and lead;
and briefly hold
 this strangely solid planet
balanced upon
 your strangely solid head.

TWIN MYSTERY 

To many people artists seem
 undisciplined and lawless.
Such laziness, with such great gifts,

One mystery is how they make

another, what they're doing with
 their energy and time.

THOUGHTS AND THINGS 

I concentrate on

The thing that distinguishes

ON BEING ONESELF
Good resolution grook 

If virtue

UNPLUMBED DEPTHS
Grook on philo-sophistical and other -isms 

Philo-sophisticism
 with hypnotic
effect affects
 the boobies that abound:
being so bottomlessly
 idiotic
that even they

ORIGINALITY 

Original thought
 is a straightforward process.
It's easy enough
 when you know what to do.
You simply combine
 in appropriate doses
the blatantly false

WISDOM IS - 

Wisdom is
the booby prize
given when you've been
unwise.

--

THE OPPOSITE VIEW 

For many system shoppers it's
 a good-for-nothing system
that classifies as opposites
 stupidity and wisdom. 

because by logic-choppers it's
 accepted with avidity:
stupidity's true opposite's
 the opposite stupidity.

THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF GASTRONOMY 

There's a rule for proper doses

And if someone at the table

Hallelujah! I'd be able
to absorb a little more.

HANDSOME IS -
Portrait-grook 

He's gallantry personified;

IDLE FELLOW
Portrait-grook 

Professsor Blooby doesn't see the fun
in what his fellow-man call relaxation.
He isn't ignorant of how it's done,
but lacks the necessary application.

--

A DIPLOMATIC COMPROMISE 

A fellow I know
can get mountains to move
and all opposition
appeases:
he preaches what God
cannot help but approve,
and does
what the Devil he pleases.

--

NOVELTY 

For me there is something ineffably new
 in every new moment's arising;
and even the things I habitually do
 have qualities new and surprising. 

There's nothing that happens that happened before
 in exactly that way in its life.
When you're playing the piano, it's rather a bore;
 but it's nice when you're kissing your wife.

SIMILARITY
Commutative Law 

No cow's like a horse,

There's an art of knowing when.
Never try to guess.
Toast until it smokes and then

GOOD ADVICE

Shun advice

(on Denmark)

Denmark seen from a foreign land

Denmark as we Danes conceive it

THOSE WHO KNOW

Those who always

a universal pest.

SATURATION

The heavens are draining,

Those who have no wisedom yet count their wealth by what they get.

Stomach-ache can be a curse;

THE WISDOM OF THE SPHERES

How instructive
is a star!
It can teach us
from afar
just how small
each other are.

--

IT ISN'T ENOUGH

One paramount truth
our society smothers
in petty concern
with position and pelf:
It isn't enough
to exasperate others;
you've got to remember
to gladden yourself.

--

SMALL THINGS AND GREAT

He that lets
the small things bind him
leaves the great
undone behind him.

BRAVE

To be brave is to behave
bravely when your heart is faint.
So you can be really brave 
only when you really ain't.

THE STATE

Nature, our father and mother,
gave us all we have got.
The state, our elder brother,
swipes the lot.

PRESENCE OF MIND

You'll conquer the present
suspiciously fast
if you smell of the future -

MAKING AN EFFORT

Our so-called limitations, believe,
apply to faculties we don't apply.
We don't discover what we can't achieve
until we make an effort not to try.

CONSTITUTIONAL POINT

Power corrupts, where
as sound opposition

democratic tradition.
One thing would make a 
democracy flower:
having a strong opposition -

RHYME AND REASON

There was an old woman
who lived in a shoe.
She had so many children.
She didn't know what to do.
But try as she would 
she could never detect
which was the cause

--

WIDE ROAD

To make a name for learning 
when other roads are barred,
take something very easy
and make it very hard.

--

THE ONLY SOLUTION

We shall have to evolve
problem-solvers galore-
since each problem they solve

REFLECTION ON SIZE

Small people often overrate
the charm of being tall;
which is, that you appreciate
the charm of being small.

--

A REPROOF
Grook in answer to a long explanitory letter

In view of your manner
of spending your days
I hope you may learn,
before ending them,
that the effort you spend

amending them.

STONE IN SHOE

If a nasty jagged stone
gets into your shoe,
thank the Lord it came alone -

THE UNATTAINABLE IDEAL

We ought to live
